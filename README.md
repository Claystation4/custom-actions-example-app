# custom-actions-example-app

This is an example application which shows how to build a Custom Action for Frame.io. In this example, we'll present the user with a form asking them to provide their name and favorite color. On submission, we'll present the user with a confirmation message.

For more information about how Custom Actions work, check out our [documentation](https://docs.frame.io/docs/custom-actions).

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm start
```

By default the application runs on port 3000, however this can be overrided by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

The service will need to run at a publically accessible address. For quick testing, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or similar service.
